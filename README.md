MIT xPro - Week 28 - Full Stack Restaurant Part 1 - Starter and Solution Files

In Module 29: Full-Stack Restaurant App Part 2, you’ll integrate the restaurant app with Stripe for payment processing. Finally, you’ll deploy the app to a Docker container, update Strapi to leverage a MongoDB database, and deploy the app to the cloud. This project is inspired by a tutorial by [Ryan Belke on the Strapi blog](https://strapi.io/blog/nextjs-react-hooks-strapi-food-app-1),  which you may also use as a resource to develop the app.  As he builds the app, Dr. Williams uses the following restaurants as examples. You are encouraged to create your own examples as you go through the exercise: 

[Woods Hill Table](https://www.woodshilltable.com)

[Karma Concord](https://www.karmaconcord.com)

[Fiorella's Cucina](https://www.fiorellascucina.com)

Please note that there are no solution files provided for this module. The only coding activity is Setting Up Stripe, which will require modifications specific to your computer environment so a generic solution file would be irrelevant. 

1. Integrate Stripe into a full-stack application

2. Research tools and frameworks that you can use with the MERN Stack

3. Explain how new technologies fit into the MERN stack
